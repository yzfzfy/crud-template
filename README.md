This project is a template page code based on the React framework and Ant Design (antd) component library. It provides my best practices for developing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pages. The key is abstracting common logic for table components in business scenarios, improving development efficiency, and primarily serving as a code base for copying during page development. Currently, the code depends on Ant Design 5.x and Next.js 15.x, but these are not mandatory; please adapt accordingly if using other versions.
